## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test before deploying**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   If this fails, fix errors before pushing to GitHub

2. **Use meaningful commit messages**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: certification verification badges"
   ```

3. **Check Vercel build logs**
   If deployment fails, check the logs in Vercel dashboard

4. **Keep Firebase keys secure**
   Never commit .env file to GitHub (it's in .gitignore)

5. **Monitor your app**
   Check Vercel Analytics to see how many people use your app
